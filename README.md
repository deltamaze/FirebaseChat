# FirebaseChat
Website to play with Firebase, and Firebase rules. Rules in place: on submit, log time, and create a 500ms window for messages to get created, then lock out table for 2 seconds.

To start, download/clone, run NPM Install, and set up your Firebase connection in the app.module.ts file.
